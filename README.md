# Flotation_Plant_Silica_prediction
Predict Silica % for forth floatation plant base on Kaggle dataset.
the repo was formed by four jupyter notebooks including data processing, eda, training and explanation steps.  
1. data_prepross_v1.ipynb: clean the dataset
2. eba.ipynb: observed featrue relations and data distribution
3. training.ipynb: train models ustilized lstm or gru to predict impurity(percentage of Silica) of the forth floatation plant
4. explanation&interpret.ipynb: train a tree based model for explanation and interpretation
